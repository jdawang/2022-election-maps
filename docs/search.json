The second map uses a proxy for votes for Lai: total mayoral votes minus total votes for councillor.\nIn the official results map, Myers does well throughout the ward with a main gap surrounding Midland in the north.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerally it seems like people knew that their vote for Lai would not be counted, though there are some pockets here and there where she got a quarter or more of the vote."

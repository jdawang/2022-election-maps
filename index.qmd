I decided to spend some time mapping out the poll-by-poll results for each of the council races. A lot of the races were not close so the maps just show a blowout.

Notes:

\- I decided to arbitrarily include some candidates for some wards, based on endorsement by [More Neighbours Toronto](https://www.moreneighbours.ca) or just because I wanted to.

\- The default map is the winner's margin over the second place candidate overall, not in each poll.

\- Legends are a bit of a mess, but you can clean them up by toggling on and off the different layers.

\- You can toggle popular vote layers for certain candidates.

\- For the poll (point) results, the size of the marker is the total number of votes cast, the shade is the percent point margin or percent popular vote.

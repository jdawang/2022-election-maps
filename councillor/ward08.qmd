Colle did well throughout. Sambasivam's best area was just west of Yonge

```{r}
ward8_mv <- margin_mapview(
  councillor_polls[[8]], 
  councillor_subdivisions[[8]],
  "Colle Mike",
  "Sambasivam Evan",
  RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(5, "PRGn")
) +
  popular_vote_mapview(
    councillor_polls[[8]], 
    councillor_subdivisions[[8]],
    "Colle Mike",
    RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(5, "Greens")
  ) +
  popular_vote_mapview(
    councillor_polls[[8]], 
    councillor_subdivisions[[8]],

removeMapJunk(ward8_mv, c("homeButton", "easyButton"))

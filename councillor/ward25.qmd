McKelvie did well throughout, but there are a few pockets where she tied or actually did a bit worse than Kanakaratnam.

```{r}
ward25_mv <- margin_mapview(
  councillor_polls[[25]], 
  councillor_subdivisions[[25]],
  "McKelvie Jennifer",
  "Kanakaratnam Jacinta",
  rev(RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(5, "RdBu"))
) +
  popular_vote_mapview(
    councillor_polls[[25]], 
    councillor_subdivisions[[25]],
    "McKelvie Jennifer",
    RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(5, "Reds")
  ) +
  popular_vote_mapview(
    councillor_polls[[25]], 
    councillor_subdivisions[[25]],
    "Kanakaratnam Jacinta",
    RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(5, "Blues")
  )
removeMapJunk(ward25_mv, c("homeButton", "easyButton"))
```
